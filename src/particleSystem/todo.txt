The particle system is currently quite developed, but still needs a bit of work:
	1. Particle colours are not supported.
	2. Need to think about how textures and animations should be utilized.
	3. Cubic spline interpolation hasn't been implemented for beam renderers yet.
	4. Rotations and billboards aren't implemented properly.
	5. Particles should be stored as a structure of arrays, not an array of structures.
	6. Need to think about when uniforms, textures and shader programs should be bound.
	7. Work has been done to support sorting, but it hasn't been implemented yet.
Besides that stuff, though, just about everything else should be more or less functional!
