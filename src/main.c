#warning "Differentiate between joints and constraints. Constraints are always between two physics objects and joints often have an anchor point."

#warning "Should we use our 'R' math functions? It would also be a good idea to stop passing so many things by pointer."
#warning "We can't be naive about it though, in some situations (such as adding one vector to another) it's better to use the pointer functions rather than doing an extra copy."
#warning "Maybe consider adding 3x4 matrices too, as most of our uses for 4x4 matrices don't even need the last row."

#warning "Should resource arrays be sorted? Then we could use a binary search to find particular items by name."
#warning "What if we just load everything in alphabetical order? Is that possible?"

#warning "When we implement intrinsics, use '_MM_SET_FLUSH_ZERO_MODE(_MM_FLUSH_ZERO_ON)' to better handle subnormal numbers."
#warning "People suggest that '-ffast-math' and '-Ox' should do this anyway, but this doesn't seem to be the case on my system."

#warning "Our modules define a lot of functions that are identical or almost identical."
#warning "Would it be possible to avoid defining the duplicate functions by using macros?"
#warning "We could even go so far as to define the entire set of functions using a single macro."

#warning "Can we combine some of our memory allocations (for components of models, texture groups, skeletons, etcetera) into just one?"
#warning "This probably won't be as necessary when we create binary formats for things."
#warning "Besides being harder to allocate, this is also somewhat harmful if we need to reallocate individual arrays."

#warning "We need to implement mipmaps for textures and levels of detail for models."
#warning "Texture groups should store scrolling information (maybe other things too?) per-animation."

#warning "At the moment, particle systems have only a single renderer (more or less equivalent to Source's 'animated sprite' renderer."
#warning "It would be good to have a 'line' mode for rendering particles so we can render trails:"

#warning "Maybe use the Source engine for inspiration, as their rope renderer is similar."
#warning "The particles should really just store points and directions."
#warning "We should interpolate between the points using a spline curve, then somehow generating a triangle strip for them."
#warning "Check the polyboard technique in 'Mathematics for 3D Game Programming and Computer Graphics -- it's exactly what we want."
#warning "It would also be a good idea to add something like Source's 'control points':"
/* https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Control_Point_(particles) */

#warning "We should try and put our graphics rendering code all in one place."
#warning "The shader-related code could use some simplification."
#warning "Maybe use a uniform buffer object for the view-projection matrix, too."
#warning "It would be good to have a proper render queue that sorts objects based on their textures."
#warning "Essentially, what we want is something like the render loop in 'Approaching Zero Driver Overhead'."
#warning "Another idea is to use the method presented in 'Order your graphics draw calls around!'"

/**
*** Important To-Do List:
***
*** 1. Finish the last few physics constraints (hinge, revolute, prismatic).
***    Don't worry about the extra features such as restitution, softness,
***    warm starting or Gauss-Seidel just yet.
***
*** 2. Particle renderers and control points. We should have at least two
***    renderers, "animated sprite" and "rope". Maybe investigate Source's
***    "sprite trail" renderer, too.
