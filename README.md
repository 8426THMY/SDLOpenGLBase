# SDLOpenGLBase
An graphical application framework built using SDL2 and the OpenGL graphics API. This is very far from completion, meaning most of the code is temporary, but I am working on it actively. Despite that, I will probably only push major changes to Github, so updates will likely be rare.

Features that need to be completed:

* Skeletal animation. Though animations can be loaded and viewed, a lot of the functions are placeholders and it thus lacks a significant amount of the functionality I would like it to have.
* Physics engine. The beginning of a physics engine exists right now, but it is very much a work in progress and does not function at all. I would like to allow physical simulation of bones to enable things such as jiggle bones or ragdolls.
* Batched sprite system.
* Quake-like console.
* Multi-threading.

Note: In a future commit I'll probably include some of my sample resources so you can actually see what's happening. At the moment, feel free to download the binary if you want to be treated to a black screen.
