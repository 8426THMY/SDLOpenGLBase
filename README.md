# SDLOpenGLBase
An graphical application framework built using SDL2 and the OpenGL graphics API. This is very far from completion, meaning most of the code is temporary, but I am working on it actively. Despite that, I will probably only push major changes to Github, so updates will likely be rare.

Features that need to be completed:

* Skeletal animation. This should be mostly completed, but it needs to be optimized a bit more.
* Physics engine. The components exist and are fully implemented save for a few constraints, but it needs testing.
* Source-like particle system. This is mostly implemented, but there are still a few missing features.
* GUI system. Panels and text rendering has been implemented, but there is a lot of temporary code and they still lack some functionality.
* Quake-like console.
* Multi-threading.

Note: In a future commit I'll probably include some of my sample resources so you can actually see what's happening. At the moment, feel free to download the binary if you want to be treated to a black screen.
